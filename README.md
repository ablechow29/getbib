# getbib
This is a bash script adopted from [LukeSmith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz)'s [personal script](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/getbib).

The getbib script intends to take advantage of [LaTeX's bibliography management](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management) (e.g., BibTeX), which calls forward a .bib file containing all relevant bibliographic information.

Each bibliographic entry looks like this:
```
@article{greenwade93,
    author  = "George D. Greenwade",
    title   = "The {C}omprehensive {T}ex {A}rchive {N}etwork ({CTAN})",
    year    = "1993",
    journal = "TUGBoat",
    volume  = "14",
    number  = "3",
    pages   = "342--351"
}
```
I used a version of this script while writing my M.S. thesis to create my LaTeX bibliography. However,
