# getbib
This is a bash script adopted from [LukeSmith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz)'s [personal script](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/getbib).

I used a version of this script to generate the `.bib` file when writing my thesis. But it did not reliably extract the doi strings from the PDF files.

attach example .bib file

The script getbib.sh is my work in progress version

getbib_luke.sh is the version acquired from LukeSmith's github (find and update location of exact file, it is located in his void linux repository)
